        <h2>Form Design Research</h2>
            <section>

                    In order to research form design, I read an article called <i>Best Practices for Form Design</i> by Salim Ansari. In Ansari's article, he details some of the ways in which designers can create forms that are effective and easy to use. I found some of his tips to be incredibly helpful and unintuitive.

                    One example is that he expresses the issues associated with using inline labels and placeholder text: this text disappears when users start typing. It’s better to have discrete “helper” text nearby that will stay put and make the process of filling out a form easier.

                    Ansari said something in his article that resonates with me: “As product designers, it is our responsibility to ensure that users of all abilities should be able to access what we create.” As a designer, I try to remain vigilant in learning about ways in which the designs I create are ensuring accessibility. People fill out forms for a variety of important reasons, so designers need to make sure that these forms are readable, easy to navigate, and organized in a way that encourages and aids users in filling them out.

                    I’m always interested in learning about user experiences with designs. Perhaps the valuable lesson I have learned as a designer thus far is that accessibility issues are not all intuitive. We need to do research and ask questions in order to make designs that function properly for everybody who needs to access them!

                    An example of an online form that I find to be really effective is Omanda Health's contact form. The webpage itself is simple and easy to nagivate. There is an initial bar that asks what users need help with, and subsequent forms that follow. They have inline text in the form boxes, but they also include clear outside text that gives users the easiest possible user experience. Here is a link to their website if you'd like to take a look: <a href="https://www.omadahealth.com/contact">Omanda Health Contact Form</a>.
